Assignment: Counter Component (TypeScript + Tailwind)
Context
    You’re building a reusable Counter UI for a training app. The component must be implemented in React + TypeScript and styled using Tailwind CSS. 
    The counter supports an interval prop to control the step size and enforces an action limit of 10 clicks (increment or decrement combined). 
    After the limit, the counter disables increment/decrement and enables Reset.

Core Requirements

    State & Props
        Internal state: count: number, flag: boolean (true when action limit reached).
        Prop: interval?: number (default 1).

    Behavior
        Increment/Decrement change count by interval.
        Track total clicks (inc + dec). When clicks > 9, set flag to true and disable inc/dec buttons.
        Reset sets count to 0, resets click count to 0, and sets flag to false.

    Accessibility
        Buttons must have accessible labels.
        Focus states must be visible.

    TypeScript
        Strongly type props and state. Avoid any.

    Styling
        Use Tailwind CSS.
        Create a clean, responsive “card” UI with:
            Title header
            Read-only count display
            Three controls: +, −, Reset
            A subtle progress bar (0–10) for the action limit
            A small badge showing the current step (interval)

Acceptance Criteria
    Incrementing and decrementing changes the value by interval.
    After 10 total actions, + and − disable; Reset enables.
    Reset returns the UI to the initial state and re-enables +/−.
    Component renders correctly in both default and interval={10} variants.
    UI is visually tidy, responsive, and keyboard-accessible.
